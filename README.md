# Indian-Buffet-Process
Python code that demonstrates how data generated from an IBP changes as you vary the process hyperparameters

The Indian Buffet Process (IBP) is a Bayesian nonparametric method for unsupervised learning. The IBP can determine the number of latent variables that generated the observed data without having the user to initially specify the number of latent variables. 

The IBP generates binary matrices by having "customers" arrive at a buffet line and select dishes. The intial customer selects a certain number of dishes
